        Norman Ernest Borlaug (March 25, 1914 - September 12,
          2009) was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that
          contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production
          termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for
          his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of
          Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal, one of only seven people to
          have received all three awards. Borlaug received his B.S. in
          forestry in 1937 and PhD in plant pathology and genetics from the
          University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research
          position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf,
          high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.During the
          mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding
          varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to
          Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter
          of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled
          in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those
          nations.[5] Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green
          Revolution",and is credited with saving over a billion people
          worldwide from starvation.According to Jan
          Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize
          Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997
          article "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity." The article states that
          the "form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a
          billion deaths."Dennis T. Avery also estimated that the number of
          lives saved by Borlaug's efforts to be one billion. In 2009,
          Josette Sheeran, then the Executive Director of the World Food
          Programme, stated that Borlaug "saved more lives than any man in human
          history". He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition
          of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.
          Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food
          production in Asia and Africa. He was also an accomplished
          wrestler in college and a pioneer of wrestling in the United States,
          being inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame for his
          contributions.
